                      This setting is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the list defines one tab.
                      Dictionaries with their *type* key set to 'Hierarchy' should have they following keys:
                      *caption* specifies the name of the tab, *root* specifies the path to the root
                      of the project hierarchy to display.
                      Dictionaries with their *type* key set to 'Query' should have they following keys:
                      *caption* specifies the name of the tab, *entity_type* specifies the ShotGrid entity
                      type to display. *filters* is a list of standard API ShotGrid filters.
                      *hierarchy* is a list of ShotGrid fields, defining the grouping of the tree.
                      Optionally, you can specify a *publish_filters* key, containing ShotGrid API filters to
                      apply to the publishes listing as it is being loaded in the main view."
